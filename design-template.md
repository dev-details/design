# Design Template

We want a lightweight and autonomous design process. We want "just enough" information for stakeholders to move forward.

When should the Design Doc Template be used?

- When there is too much ambiguity
- When multiple teams are impacted
- When multiple teams will implement
- When the scope or risk is high (one-way vs a two-way door)

When is a design document too much? 

- When the task is small, only one team is impacted by the change.
- Even then, the same principles of design apply, you might not need a document to represent it. Capture the information in the story.

How much design is enough? 

- When the functional and non-functional requirements are clear
- When everyone is aligned
- When you have enough information that all parties say "we're good to go"
- For more risk, or two-way doors, more design is needed

What is an ideal design document?

# {Design Name}
<!--
The sections below are meant to drive conversation and consideration. They are not mandatory. Add or remove sections as you see fit based on the scope and complexity of the design. Something with smaller scope and complexity should have fewer sections. Only leave in sections that have relevant information.

Ground rules:

- Prefer diagrams over description. Prefer text-to-diagram solutions over drag-and-drop.
- Prefer links over repeating information. This will create a graph of backlinks.
- Rather than ask questions, make assumptions. It is better to put something that is wrong on paper to discuss than it is to ask open ended questions.
- Document assumptions as assumptions, get alignment from stakeholders, restate as declarations.
- Use a live-document format that supports inline comments, editing without friction, and judicious links.
- Call out patterns (architecture, software, etc.). They are a shorthand for understanding.
-->

## Context

<!--
Context is more important than the solution. This is a live document. Need to understand the problem so that the team can pivot as much as needed to deliver a solution. Leave the details for as late as practical.

- What, why, how, who, when 
- Problem statement (the what), particularly user or business pain points
- Current state and how it falls short of the business need
- Why this change needs doing from a business perspective (business needs, the why)
- Level 1 or 2 [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) diagram
-->

Problem (The What)

<!--
What problem are we trying to solve? This should be oriented around the customer's need.
-->

### Business Needs (The Why)

<!--
Business needs represent the 'why' of a project. They articulate the objectives or problems a business aims to address. These might be strategic goals, like expanding into a new market, operational goals, like improving efficiency, or customer-focused goals, like enhancing user experience.

Business impact is the most crucial consideration of a design. If it does not satisfy the needs of the business, what is the point?Â For small projects, you can interweave the Business Needs into Context and remove this heading.
-->

### Functional Requirements (The How)

<!--
Functional requirements represent the 'how' -- how we will solve the customer problem -- not the implementation details. They lay out in detail the functionality that a system, application, or product must have to meet the identified business needs. They describe the features a system must possess.

Describe what a system should do. For example, an e-commerce website should be able to display product details when a user clicks on a product.
-->

### Non-functional requirements (The How Much)

<!--
Non-functional requirements, as opposed to functional requirements, specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. They are also known as "qualities" of the system. Non-functional requirements are crucial to the success of software and systems because they control attributes such as reliability, performance, security, portability, and usability.

Describe how a system performs a certain function. For instance, the e-commerce website must be able to load the product details within two seconds 95% of the time.

Do back of the napkin math. How many daily users? How many requests per second? How much data will that create? How long will that data be retained? How much up-time is required?

All these requirements put constraint on how 
-->

### Use Cases

<!--
Use Cases are a method to identify, define, and organize system requirements. Each of these use cases represents a function or a goal a user can achieve using the system. Typically "{actor} wants to {action}, so that {outcome}"
-->

### Exclusions

<!--
Things we are explicitly not doing. It is just important to call out what we're not doing as to call out what we are. If we've explicitly decided not to do something, record what that is and why.
-->

- {exclusion 1}

## Solution

<!-- 
This section explains how the identified problem will be solved. It should describe the proposed solution in detail. Favor diagram (PlantUML/C4) over text.
-->

### Implementation Details

<!-- 
Provide the details of how the solution will be implemented. This could include information about specific technologies, atypical algorithms, architecture diagrams, or code snippets. Avoid going too deep into low-level specifics. 
-->

- {detail 1}

### {Topic}

<!-- 
If the solution has different components or aspects, consider breaking them down into subtopics. 
-->
  
- {detail 1}

### Data Model

<!-- 
This section describes the data structures or the database schema used in the solution. This could be presented in the form of diagrams, tables, or descriptive text. The goal is to give a clear idea of how data is organized, stored, and accessed. 
-->

{data model overview}

#### {model 1}

{model description}

## Deployment

<!-- 
Describe how the system will be deployed, including the environments (development, testing, production), the process, and any tools or technologies used. You may also wish to cover any prerequisites, dependencies, or steps to verify successful deployment. 
-->

### Observability

<!--
Non-functional requirements describe the required uptime, performance, etc. Observability is how we measure that we are meeting those non-functional requirements.
-->

#### Metrics

<!--
Measure how the system is performing. What are the _failure_
and _success_ conditions.
-->

- {metric 1}

#### Logging

<!--
Are there any special considerations for logging? Will particular messages be logged or queries that will help with debugging, customer support, etc?
-->

- {logging 1}

#### Alerts

<!--
How will you know the system is behaving outside normal parameters.

Consider business case metrics. These are often indicators of a business problem before they are a technical problem. 

For example, deviation from normal sales volume may indicate that there is a critical problem that is not being triggered by performance metrics.
-->

### Infrastructure

<!-- 
Outline any infrastructure changes that will need to be implemented for the new solution. This could include hardware, networks, servers, or third-party services. 
-->

### Privacy and Security

<!--
Discuss the privacy and security implications of the system, such as encryption, access controls, data anonymization, and compliance with relevant regulations. Be sure to address any potential threats and how they will be mitigated. 
-->

- {security 1}

### API

<!-- 
Provide a detailed overview of the application's API, including each endpoint, its purpose, the HTTP methods it supports, the data it accepts, and the data it returns. 

A specification format (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema) should be used to document the API. Instead of putting in the design document, you can link to a repository or pull request for this. At the very lest, this could be represented as a table or a list, and may include example requests and responses. 
-->

The API has the following endpoints:

1. `{path}` - A `{HTTP method}` endpoint {description}.

## Impact

<!--
Is there a meaningful impact of this change on the system? Who is affected (business, customers, or other teams)? This may include benefits such as improved efficiency, cost savings, increased customer satisfaction, or other key metrics. Also consider potential negative impacts, such as disruption to existing processes, and how these will be mitigated.
-->

## Alternatives Considered

<!--
Were alternative implementations considered? Why were they ultimately not used?
-->

## Questions and Concerns

<!--
Anticipate questions. Answer them in the rest of the design.

For explicit questions, list them here, along with their answer. Then incorporate the answer into the design.

If the answer is not know, put a todo. All todos should be resolved before moving forward with the design.
-->

## Glossary

<!-- 
Define domain-specific terminology that's necessary to understand this document. It helps in improving the clarity of the document and ensures all readers are on the same page. 
-->

- {Term 1}: {Definition}

## Risks and Mitigations

<!--
Every project carries some risk. Identifying what could go wrong and how it will be addressed is crucial to any design document. Potential risks could be technical, operational, organizational, or related to the market or product.
-->

- {Risk 1}: {Mitigation Strategy}

### Technical Debt

<!--
Technical Debt should be taken on with eyes wide open. It's a conscious decision to do take a short cut. Why are we taking that short cut? What debt are we incurring?

Record Technical Debt so we understand the risk we are assuming and the cost (with interest) that we're going to pay to address. 
-->

## Milestones

<!--
Break down large work into milestones. Earlier milestones have more detail. The details get more nebulous the further out the milestone.
-->

## Conventions

<!--
This section is for conventions used for this implementation. Style guide, best practices, etc. If your team already has standard conventions in place, no need to reiterate them here.
-->
